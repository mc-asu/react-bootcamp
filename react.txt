# Function Components
- historically used for simpler "dumb" Components
- write logic in a JS Function
- no render method needed, just return content

function Dog() {
    return `<div>Dog</div>`
}

# Class Components
- needs render
- write logic in a JS Class
- traditional React component

class Dog extends React.component {
    render() {
        return <div>dog</dog>
    }
}

## Function vs Class Components
- both can accept props and render content
- function components couldn't use important features like state and lifecycle methods
- full-featured function components with hooks

#JSX - Javascript Extension / Javascript + XAML
- not legal JS -> has to be transpiled to JS with Babel
- more strict than HTML
